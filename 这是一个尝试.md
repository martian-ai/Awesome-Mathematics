# Restricted boltzmann machines(RBMs)

1. RBMs are shallow, two-layer neural nets that constitute the building blocks of deep-belief networks
2. The first layer of RBMs is called the visible or input,while the second is the hidden layer
3. the basic element in the layer is node (neuron-like unit) and nodes are simply where calculations take place
4. the nodes are connected to each other across layers, but no two nodes of the same layer are linked. This is the restriction in a restricted boltzmann machine.

## Representation Learning

1. Representation learning meaning learning representations of the data that make it to extract useful information when building classifier or other predictors

2. In the case of probabilistic models, a good representation is often one that captures the posterior distribution of the underlying explanatory factors for the observed input

3. Learning word embeddings can be combined with learning image representation in a way that allow to associate text and images.

4. Transfer learning is the ability of a learning algorithm to exploit commonalities between different leaning tasks in order to share statistical strength

   ### Prior for representation learning in AI

   1. Smoothness : kernel machines with a fixed generic local-response kernel, most of which only exploit the principle of local generalization i.e., the assumption  that the target function is smooth enough, so they rely on examples to explicitly map out the wrinkles of the target function

   2. Distributed representations: representations are expressive,meaning that a reasonably-sized learned representations can capture a huge number of possible input configurations 

      **one-hot representation**:such as traditional clustering algorithms, gaussian mixtures, nearest neighbor algorithms, decision tree, gaussian svms

      **sparse representations**: distributed representations where only a few of the elements can varied at a time,i.e., k<N(N is the dimension of the input)

      **Nominal category or nominal group** is a group of object or ideas that can be collectively grouped on the basis of a particular characteristic-a qualitative property,

      **categorical variable** that codes whether each one in a set of observations is in a particular nominal category
